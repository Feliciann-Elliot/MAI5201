**ELIZA—a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine**

Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA in 1966, a pioneering computer program designed for the study of natural language communication between humans and machines. Operating within the MIT MAC time-sharing system, ELIZA processed what a user typed by looking for specific words, called keywords. If a keyword was found, ELIZA used simple rules to change the user's sentence and create a reply. The most famous version pretended to be a therapist called DOCTOR. As Weizenbaum explained, "The text is read and inspected for the presence of a keyword. If such a word is found, the sentence is transformed according to a rule associated with the keyword" (Weizenbaum, 1966, p. 37). This fundamental process was essentially text manipulation.

ELIZA's behaviors were defined by a "script," which was treated as data separate from the program itself. This meant ELIZA was flexible and "not restricted to a particular set of recognition patterns or responses, indeed not even to any specific language. ELIZA scripts exist (at this writing) in Welsh and German as well as in English" (Weizenbaum, 1966, p. 38). The most recognized script allowed ELIZA to act like a therapist, a choice made because a therapist can converse without needing much real-world knowledge. Despite its simple internal workings, ELIZA often led people to believe it understood them, with some finding it "very hard to convince that ELIZA... is not human" (Weizenbaum, 1966, p. 41). However, ELIZA did not truly understand since the program’s main objective was the "concealment of its lack of understanding" (Weizenbaum, 1966, p. 41).

The program did not automatically learn or improve its responses, relying on pre-programmed scripts. ELIZA demonstrated that computers could engage in plausible conversations, even if the "understanding" was simulated, raising important questions about the credibility of machine output. ELIZA proved that computers could interact with people using normal language, even if it was fake understanding. This inspired decades of research into chatbots, virtual assistants, and translation programs. It also made people think about whether computers that seem human might trick or manipulate users. ELIZA was not revolutionary, but it was a useful first step toward modern AI that can chat with people.
